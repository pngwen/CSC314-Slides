# CSC314-Slides
These are slides for my CSC314 Data Mining class.

I am morally opposed to committing rendered pdf's, so if you want to
see them in rendered form, you should take a look at my course
website.  There you will find the current iteration of the course, as
well as previous versions.  You will also be able to follow my
assignments!

I have included a build script which builds both the handout and the
presentation modes of the slides.  To use it just do:
  ./build <filename>
